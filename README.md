Hello everyone,
I choose Montserrat for the typeface, the reason for this type is I like how the typeset looks as a headline. The word ‘Demographic’ shows this.  It is spaced, nicely and it jumps out at you like a headline. I also like it for business advertising, i.e., Stationary, clothing, bags, and so on.  I’m building a website for a business and this typeface would be perfect for the main type.  
Montserrat was created by Julieta Ulanovsky. It was the traditions of her Buenos Aires neighborhood that inspired this design.  The typeface rescued the beauty of urban typography, this emerged in the twentieth century’s first half.    You can read more about it on the page.  
This typeface has two sister typefaces, ‘Alternates’ it has a unique glyph. And Subrayada which means underlined in Spanish. 
I chose the colors that would be attractive to the eye and draw them in to look.  Think of childhood memories and special moments shared in their life, also seeing a way to exercise the be prompted to purchase.
I’d use Montserrat as the main type and one of the companion types for the subheadings and paragraph.
